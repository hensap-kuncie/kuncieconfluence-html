Our company uses global electronic communications and resources as routine parts of our business activities. It is essential that electronic resources used to perform company business are protected to ensure that these resources are accessible for business purposes and operated in a cost-effective manner, that our company’s reputation is protected, and that we minimize the potential for legal risk.</p><p>Those receiving Kuncie-provided assets are responsible for exercising good judgment when using Kuncie-managed computers and accessing Kuncie-managed data.</p><p>As per the <u>onboarding issue procedures </u><strong><u>&lt;Insert Link&gt;</u></strong> outlined in our handbook, evidence of device encryption and device serial number must be provided to IT Ops prior to the completion of onboarding period.</p><h3 id="InternalAcceptableUsePolicy-SecurityandProprietaryInformation">Security and Proprietary Information</h3><p>All Kuncie data is categorized and must be handled in accordance with the <u>Data Classification Standard </u><strong><u>&lt;Insert Link&gt;</u></strong>. All computing assets that connect to any part of the Kuncie network, or 3rd party services that are used by Kuncie, must comply with the applicable standards.</p><h3 id="InternalAcceptableUsePolicy-Freeware,BrowserExtensions,Add-onsandPlugins">Freeware, Browser Extensions, Add-ons and Plugins</h3><p>Freeware, browser extensions, add-ons and plugins can pose a risk to Kuncie as they may contain viruses, spyware or adware. The use of freeware could result in the loss of Kuncie data and the inability to protect the data in accordance with Kuncie security and privacy requirements. Not all freeware contains malware, but team members should carefully consider the terms of service and <u>types of data</u> &lt;DCS&gt; that will be shared before installing anything on your computer.</p><p>Security reserves the right to execute security reviews against this software and dissallow use if they do not meet Kuncie's <u>security and privacy </u><strong><u>&lt;Need Link&gt;</u></strong> expectations.</p><h3 id="InternalAcceptableUsePolicy-UnacceptableUse">Unacceptable Use</h3><p>Team members and contractors may <strong>not</strong> use Kuncie-managed resources for activities that are illegal or prohibited under applicable law, no matter the circumstances.</p><h3 id="InternalAcceptableUsePolicy-UnacceptableSystemandNetworkActivities">Unacceptable System and Network Activities</h3><p>Prohibited system and network activities include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><ul><li><p>Violations of the rights of any person or company protected by copyright, trade secret, patent or other intellectual property, or similar laws or regulations.</p></li><li><p>Unauthorized copying, distribution, or use of copyrighted material.</p></li><li><p>Exporting software, technical information, encryption software, or technology in violation of international or national export control laws.</p></li><li><p>Intentional introduction of malicious programs into Kuncie networks or any Kuncie-managed computing device.</p></li><li><p>Intentional misuse of any Kuncie-managed computing device or Kuncie networks (e.g. for cryptocurrency mining, botnet control, etc.).</p></li><li><p>Sharing your credentials for any Kuncie-managed computer or 3rd party service that Kuncie uses with others, or allowing use of your account or a Kuncie-managed computer by others. This prohibition does not apply to single-sign-on or similar technologies, the use of which is approved.</p></li><li><p>Using a Kuncie computing asset to procure or transmit material that is in violation of sexual harassment policies or that creates a hostile workplace.</p></li><li><p>Making fraudulent offers of products, items, or services originating from any Kuncie account.</p></li><li><p>Intentionally accessing data or logging into a computer or account that the team member or contractor is not authorized to access, or disrupting network communication, computer processing, or access.</p></li><li><p>Executing any form of network monitoring that intercepts data not intended for the team member’s or contractor's computer, except when troubleshooting networking issues for the benefit of Kuncie.</p></li><li><p>Circumventing user authentication or security of any computer host, network, or account used by Kuncie.</p></li><li><p>Tunneling between network segments or security zones (e.g., <code>gprd</code>, <code>gstg</code>, <code>ops</code>, <code>ci</code>), except when troubleshooting issues for the benefit of Kuncie.</p></li><li><p>Given the potential sensitivity of the data contained in screenshot images, the use of tools that capture and share screenshots to hosted sites online is prohibited without the explicit approval of the Security and Legal Departments. Screenshots should be stored locally or within Google drive folders associated with your <a href="https://kuncie.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Kuncie.com</a> account. Access to these drives and files should be managed in accordance with our Access Control policy, and handled according to our <u>Data Classification Policy </u><strong><u>&lt;Insert Link&gt;</u></strong>. Tools such as <a href="https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>Lightshot</u></a>, where upload functionality cannot be disabled and could result in inadvertant uploads, should not be used.</p></li></ul><h3 id="InternalAcceptableUsePolicy-UnacceptableEmailandCommunicationsActivities">Unacceptable Email and Communications Activities</h3><p>Forwarding of confidential business emails or documents to personal external email addresses is prohibited.</p><blockquote><p>Note: Kuncie may retrieve messages from archives and servers without prior notice if Kuncie has sufficient reason to do so. If deemed necessary, this investigation will be conducted with the knowledge and approval of the Security, People Business Partners, and Legal Departments.</p></blockquote><p>When utilizing social media think about the effects of statements that you make. Keep in mind that these transmissions are permanent and easily transferable, and can affect our company’s reputation and relationships with team members and customers. When using social media tools like blogs, Facebook, Twitter or wikis, ensure that you do not make comments on behalf of Kuncie without proper authorization. Also, you must not disclose our company’s confidential or proprietary information about our business, our suppliers, or our customers.</p><h3 id="InternalAcceptableUsePolicy-ReturnofKuncie-OwnedAssets">Return of Kuncie-Owned Assets</h3><p>All Kuncie-owned computing resources must be returned upon separation from the company.</p><h3 id="InternalAcceptableUsePolicy-Bring-Your-Own-Device(BYOD)">Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD)</h3><p>As a general rule, non-company devices are not permitted to access company assets. While there are some exceptions listed below, access to RED classified data is, as defined by the <u>Kuncie Data Classification Policy</u>, still prohibited.</p><p>The exceptions are as follows:</p><h4 id="InternalAcceptableUsePolicy-PersonalMobilePhoneandTabletUsage">Personal Mobile Phone and Tablet Usage</h4><p>All personal mobile computing devices used to access Kuncie-managed data, including but not limited to email and <a href="https://www.kuncie.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Kuncie.com</a>, must be passcode-enabled. 2FA will be enforced by the Security team for all employee and contractor <a href="https://www.kuncie.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Kuncie.com</a> and Google Workspace accounts. Mobile computing best practices dictate that these devices should be running the latest version of the operating system available, and all new patches applied. For assistance with determining the suitability of your mobile device, please contact the Security Team.</p><h4 id="InternalAcceptableUsePolicy-UnabletoUseCompanyLaptop">Unable to Use Company Laptop</h4><p>For new employees who have not received a company laptop, there are exception processes for using non-company devices.</p><p>The same exception processes apply in the case of a corporate laptop being unavailable due to loss, theft or disrepair. See lost or stolen procedures for additional information. While the exception processes are considered a temporary solution, you still need to make sure the non-company system meets basic configuration standards.</p><h3 id="InternalAcceptableUsePolicy-MobileMessaging">Mobile Messaging</h3><p>All Kuncie-related conversations need to take place in Slack. It is strongly recommended that the official Slack application, or Slack web application, are used for mobile messaging. Downloads are available for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/slack-app/id618783545?ls=1&amp;mt=8" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>iOS</u></a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Slack" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>Android</u></a>. While it may be more convenient to use an integrated chat application that puts all of your conversations in one place, the use of these applications can unintentionally lead to work-related conversations crossing platforms, or being sent to external contacts. The use of Slack for all work communications assists with our security and compliance efforts. For example, in the case of an incident response issue, it may be necessary to review a conversation to understand the order in which events occurred, or to provide evidence that the chain of custody has been maintained for forensic evidence during a handoff.</p><p>For video calls, and as a back-up to Slack, we prefer Zoom or Google Meet. Zoom or Google Meet chats are an acceptable alternative to Slack when in a video call. If the conversation is interesting to others or may be needed for a retrospective, consider recording the call.</p><h3 id="InternalAcceptableUsePolicy-UseofExternalMediaonCompanyAssets">Use of External Media on Company Assets</h3><p>The use of removable and external storage devices such as USB flash drives and external backup drives on company-managed devices is not officially sanctioned. If there is a business need for the use of an external storage device, such as a flash drive or an external hard drive on company devices, please contact the Security Team to determine the most suitable encryption-enabled device. All external and removable storage devices must be encrypted and protected by a passcode.</p><h3 id="InternalAcceptableUsePolicy-LostorStolenProcedures">Lost or Stolen Procedures</h3><p>Kuncie provides a <code>panic@kuncie.com</code> email address for team members to use in situations that require an immediate security response. Should a team member lose a device such as a thumb drive, mobile phone, tablet, laptop, etc. that contains their credentials or other Kuncie-sensitive data, they should send an email to <code>panic@kuncie.com</code> right away. When the production and security teams receive an email sent to this address it will be handled immediately. Using this address provides an excellent way to limit the damage caused by a loss of one of these devices.</p><p>Kuncie reserves the right to request documentation of the theft and/or a related police report in the case of a stolen laptop.</p><h3 id="InternalAcceptableUsePolicy-PolicyCompliance">Policy Compliance</h3><p>Compliance with this policy will be verified through various methods, including but not limited to, automated reporting, audits, and feedback to the policy owner.</p><p>Any team member or contractor found to be in violation of this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, or contractual agreement.</p><h2 id="InternalAcceptableUsePolicy-Exceptions">Exceptions</h2><p>Exceptions to this policy must be approved by Legal and PeopleOps Team.</p>
